*Flick App* 

Initially built at UofTHacks, this app's main intentions are to help people find events going on around them, pick events they like in a Tinder-like manner, and help people also make events for their area. 

Originally built in Java, this project was blocked by many aspects of the project, mainly being my lack of time and not enough technical knowledge in backend services, AWS and other issues. 

October 2017, this project will be reopened, using Kotlin as main base for Android version of the app, and once Android is in production, iOS version will also be created, using Swift.
